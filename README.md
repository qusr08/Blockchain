> ### Known Bugs
> - In Level 6 there are invisible floor tiles
> - In Level 11 there are invisible floor tiles
> - In Level 12, it is possible to clip through the door by activating the button and then moving overtop the door. This causes the button to be unpressed and the door to be closed again. However, since the player moves into the door as this happens, they can occupy the same space as the door and just move through it. It is also possible to skip the door completely and move to the exit because there are enough blocks to do so.
